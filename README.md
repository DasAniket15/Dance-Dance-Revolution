# Dance-Dance-Revolution

Memory games  involve memorising a series of directions given to you at random by the computer, and you have to recall the order from memory. A classic example of this game can be seen in Pok√©mon Stadium 2's Clefairy Says mini game.

Dance Dance Revolution, the game created here, is a simulated version of the game mentioned above.
